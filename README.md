- **Language:** TypeScript
- **UI:** Shadcn/UI + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion
- **State Management:** Zustand or React Context + Server Components
- **Video Player:** Custom player using [Video.js](https://videojs.com/) or [Remotion Player]

## üèóÔ∏è Drawing Technologies

For reliable annotations across all screens:
- **Konva.js** ‚Üí Canvas-based, scalable drawings with serialization (recommended)
- **Fabric.js** ‚Üí Richer features, easier freehand tools, snapshot saving
- **SVG Overlay (custom)** ‚Üí Perfect scaling on any device, ideal for static diagrams

Save drawings as **JSON state objects**, and replay using video timestamps. This guarantees the same drawings appear across all devices and resolutions.
